                <li>Information You Provide
                Some elements of the Site may ask you to submit Personal Information in order for you to
                benefit from the specified features or participate in a certain activity, such as newsletter

                related to the search request.  We may combine information you submit through the Site with
                other information we have collected from you, whether on-line or off-line.  We treat the
                    combined information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</li>
                <li>Sensitive Information
                Unless we specifically request or invite it, we ask that you not send or otherwise disclose to us
                your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal

                <li>Location Information
                Any comment system on the Site may utilize an opt-in Geolocation service in accordance with a

                <li><p>Passive Information Collection, Use, and Choices
                As you navigate the Site, certain Personal Information may be passively collected, meaning it is
                gathered without your actively providing it.  This is done using the following techniques in the
                        following ways:</p>
                    <p><i>IP Addresses:</i>  An IP address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify
                and communicate with each other on the Internet.  When you visit our Site, we may view the IP
                address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.  We use this information to determine
                the general physical location of the device and understand from what geographic regions our
                website visitors come.  We also may use this information to enhance our Site.
                Through your browser:  Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media
                Access Control (MAC) address, computer type and operating system type and version screen
                    resolution, and Internet browser type and version.</p>

                    <p><i>Social Media Widgets:</i>  Our Site may include social media tools, including social media widgets
                or plug-ins, to connect you to your social media accounts.  These features may set a cookie or
                use other automatic collection and tracking technologies to collect information about you and
                your use of the social media features through and in connection with our Site.  These social
                media tools may be hosted by a third party.  Your interactions with these tools and the
                corresponding social media platforms are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that
                    provide such platforms.</p>
                    <p><i>Cookies:</i>  Like many companies, our Site may use “cookies” to help make sure the Site is
                meeting the needs of its users and to help us make improvements. Cookies are bits of text that
                are placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites.  We may use cookies
                set by us on the Site to tell us, for example, whether you have visited us before or if you are a
                new visitor.  We use third-party cookies set by our service provider, Google Analytics, to collect
                information about how visitors use the Site, including how long you spend on each page, and
                how you got to the Site.  We do not use data collected by cookies to identify who you are.  We
                        do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data.</p>
                <p>You can refuse our use of some or all cookies by turning off the use of cookies in your web
                browser.  If you use your browser settings to block all types of cookies you may not be able to
                access all or parts of our Site or functionality may be limited.  You can set your browser to notify
                you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.  You can
                    also set your browser to turn off cookies.</p>
                <p>Changing your internet browser settings can prevent the use of cookies.  Each browser has a
                different procedure for disabling the use of cookies.  The Help function within your browser

                    <p><i>Google Analytics:</i>  We use Google Analytics, which is provided by Google, Inc.  It uses cookies
                to collect, for example, information about the operating system and the browser that you use,
                your IP address, the website you previously accessed (referrer URL) and the date and time of
                your visit to the Websites.  On subsequent repeated visits to the Websites, frequently used
                information is automatically displayed for you.  We are able to track your usage patterns with the
                help of the cookies.  The information generated by cookies about the use of the Websites is
                transmitted to a Google server, which may be located within or outside of, the United States, and
                stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the Websites. Google may
                transfer these rights to third parties insofar as it is required to do so by law or in order that data
                may be processed on Google’s behalf.  By accepting this policy, you consent to the processing of
                your data by Google.  You can visit https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html to

                in this Privacy Statement whether or not a DNT signal is received, as there is no consistent
                    industry standard for compliance.</p></li>
